ANTIGUA — The Ayre Foundation launched a program today to provide food, shelter, and education for 120 young ladies of the elite Ukrainian all-girls high school varsity dance program “Seksualʹni Molodi Zhinky Dance Ensemble” at Mr. Ayre’s private estate in Antigua.

Members of the dance team recently became refugees after their school and homes were destroyed during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and their appeal to the international community for help was answered by the Ayre Foundation with record turnaround.

 “I want to see these dancers right through college,” said Mr. Ayre. “They’ve lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can’t even fathom. And now they’ve lost their schools, families, their entire lives in the war in Ukraine. I’m just doing my part to help by giving these girls a place to keep developing their talents.”

Part of Mr. Ayre’s program includes work and and internship opportunities at BSV conference after parties, where the dancers will get hands on experience.

“It’s really just wonderful to be able to give back,” said Mr. Ayre. “I’ve been touched by all these young ladies, and I’m pretty sure I’ve touched them too.”
